# Password Generator Starter Code

# There are main module: 
# writePassword main function that actually writes the password and assigns the array of characters to randomize 
# isselection ensure that user has selected atleast one of the password criteria and password size is between 8 and 128 characters
# generatePassword generates the password based on the user criteria
# checkpassword ensures that the randomly generated password meets the user criteria. If something is missing, password is generated again. This might happen if the password length is low (e.g. 8 characters) and the randomization function misses out on selecting a number, upper case or one of the other criterion
